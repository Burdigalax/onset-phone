    "onset-phone/server.lua"
],

],
"files": [

Load player's `phone_contacts`:

```
function LoadPlayerPhoneContacts(player)
	local query = mariadb_prepare(sql, "SELECT * FROM phone_contacts WHERE phone_contacts.owner_id = ? ORDER BY phone_contacts.name;", PlayerData[player].accountid)

	mariadb_async_query(sql, query, OnPhoneContactsLoaded, player)
end

function OnPhoneContactsLoaded(player)
	for i = 1, mariadb_get_row_count() do
        local contact = mariadb_get_assoc(i)
        PlayerData[player].phone_contacts[i] = { id = tostring(contact['id']),  name = contact['name'], phone = contact['phone'] }
    end
    print("Phone contacts loaded for "..PlayerData[player].accountid)
end
```
